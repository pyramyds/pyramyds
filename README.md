  <h1>Hi there, I'm Pyra 👋</h1>
</div>

I'm a passionate explorer of programming languages and a versatile developer. I thrive on tackling new challenges, diving deep into problem-solving, and crafting innovative solutions from scratch.
From automation, problems-sloving programs, full-stack web development, and a broad range of (home-made) tools, i like to dive into every fields until i clearly understand how it works.

⚡ **My Coding Philosophy:** I primarily put my energy and mind into projects that push my boundaries, or into projets involving technologies/librairies i'm exploring for the first time. For me, every project is a fresh learning adventure.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To

* I'm always juggling multiple projects simultaneously, often leveraging different programming languages to broaden my expertise and explore new paradigms.
* 🌱 I'm continuously deepening my understanding and practical skills, especially in the **C** programming language.

### 📝 A Note on My Work & Principles

* **Repositories:** Please note that my repositories are currently private.

* **My Stance on AI in Development:**
    * I possess a deep understanding of AI systems and have dedicated significant effort to developing advanced prompting skills, tailored to the nuances of various Large Language Models (LLMs). I continuously adapt and refine these abilities as new models and techniques emerge.
    * However, guided by a strong personal and professional moral compass, I am committed to achieving mastery in my work **without the use of AI for core development tasks.**
    * Therefore, you can be assured that **all of my code is conceived, written, corrected, and debugged solely by me.** I do not use AI for any of these processes in my professional engagements.
    * My philosophy is firm: AI should be a tool that developers master, manage, and critically evaluate. It is not, in my view, a substitute for human expertise, problem-solving, or the deep learning that comes from direct engagement with challenges.
    * Yes, i have used an AI to correct and optimize this README in English 😉
